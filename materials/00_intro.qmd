## Assumptions

  * This is not an introduction to R. We assume you are broadly comfortable with R code, the RStudio environment and the tidyverse.
  * This is not a statistics course. We assume you are familiar with concepts such as the mean, standard deviation, quantiles, regression, normal distribution, likelihood, etc.
  * This is not a theory course. We are not going to derive anything. We will teach you time series and forecasting tools, when to use them, and how to use them most effectively.
